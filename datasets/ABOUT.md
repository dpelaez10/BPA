# About the Datasets

Welcome to the `datasets` directory of the National Committee on Bike, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data (NC-BPAID). This repository is a collaborative space dedicated to advancing the development, standardization, and application of geospatial data to improve infrastructure for walking, biking, and ensuring accessibility across the United States.

## Purpose of the Datasets Directory

The primary function of this directory is to share geospatial sample datasets of the infrastructure assets that require mapping. Our approach focuses on iterating on schemas, attribute fields, and metadata for various asset classes. It's important to note that the intention here is not to distribute large datasets, but rather to provide small, manageable samples. These samples are crucial for helping us align on standards and best practices in a more efficient and effective manner.

By sharing these samples, we aim to foster an environment of open communication and collaboration among stakeholders from government, academic, nonprofit, and private sectors. Together, we can create a unified approach to mapping the infrastructure that supports our communities.

## Datasets of Interest

We are focused on informing standards and best practices for mapping various aspects of infrastructure, including but not limited to:

## Sources and Generation

Data will be generated or enhanced from existing sources, including U.S. Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles, the FHWA's ARNOLD, BTS's North American Roads, and other pivotal datasets. We encourage the use of advanced techniques such as computer vision, AI, and machine learning in collaboration with existing datasets to create comprehensive data layers.

## Collaboration and Contribution

We invite contributions from all sectors working towards enhancing geospatial data for infrastructure. By joining our efforts, we can create a more connected, accessible, and safe environment for all modes of transportation.

For more details on our working groups and how to contribute, follow the Bureau of Transportation Statisticsâ€™ Working Group on Geospatial Bike, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data on Github.

Together, we can build a better future.
